Most of the icons in here come from the "Farm-Fresh Web Icons" pack from [fatcow.com](http://www.fatcow.com/free-icons).

Some icons have special notes:

* delete.png is renamed to del.png to avoid obvious clashes with the C++ keyword.
* flip_y.png is created just by rotating arrow_left.png to be vertical in the top half of the image, then rotating/flipping it to the bottom half.
* upfolder.png is created by pasting arrow_up.png on top of folder.png, then erasing all pixels that overlap the front half of the folder.
* action.png and action_hover.png are both based on document_page_next.png, with the little fold removed and colours changed.
* control_reverse_blue.png is just control_play_blue.png flipped horizontally.
* control_nan_blue.png and control_sample_blue.png are control_cursor_blue with the cursor edited out and replaced with the appropriate symbol. control_base_blue.png is not used directly but is kept in case future additions are needed.
