# Arcane-Engine
Arcane Engine is a real-time, physically based renderer built with OpenGL. A large focus of this project is to implement modern real-time graphical effects, while also making it easy to read and understand. Arcane supports forward and deferred rendering, by using the benefits of each to its advantage.

## Development
If you want to see what I am currently working on check out Arcane's roadmap:
- [Rendering Trello](https://trello.com/b/WzD2bYCD/arcane-rendering)
- [Engine Trello](https://trello.com/b/Giv16bRX/arcane-engine)

I plan on adding many different features to the forward & deferred renderers. Here are some of the few things I am really looking forward to adding:
1. Vulkan Support
1. Decals
1. Particles
1. SSR
1. Volumetric Effects
1. Reverse Z Buffer
1. Virtual Texture System (Terrain)
